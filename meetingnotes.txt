Mr. Brown meeting Notes (Meeting One):

streamlined and simple
effective web design (look it up) "flat design"
work on functional aspect that can facilitate outside delegations registering for the conference

sign up to make an account (not only for the conference, for email blasts etc
if you register it should recognize that you have an account ("is this you?")
  if you leave a field empty it will keep your data and highlight it
  head delegate registry and advisor registry (individual accounts even that get conference info?)
  "you've successfully registered"
clarify language for payment and make it easy to pay
  "This much $ is due by this date, with these consequences if no" not antagonistic
  reminds you via email
